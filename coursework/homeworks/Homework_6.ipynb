    "2. Start with kernel density estimation on the data set. First, perform a grid search $5$-fold cross-validation to find the best bandwidth, testing $30$ bandwidths between $0.1$ and $1.0$. What is this best bandwidth? Using this best bandwidth, plot the two-dimensional kernel density estimate of the distribution. \n",

    "3. Now try a nearest neighbors approach to estimating the density. Use the Bayesian nearest neighbors option. Plot the estimated distribution. What value of $k$ neighbors do you need to make the plot look similar to your KDE distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now fit a Gaussian mixture model. Compute the AIC and BIC for the number of GMM components between $1$ and $10$. Plot these AIC and BIC values as a function of number of components. What is the optimal number according to the BIC? Fit the data set with this optimal number of GMM components, and create a new plot that shows the data set, the GMM component mean locations, and the $2$-sigma GMM component ellipses. *(Use the code below to help with plotting the ellipses.)*"
