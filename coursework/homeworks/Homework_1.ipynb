    "Practice your git and GitHub skills by submitting this homework via GitHub.  You can skip Steps 1-4 if you have already completed the in-class work of Lecture 1.  Steps 5-11 are the new steps.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Navigate to https://github.com/NihanPol/ASTR_3300_S2025 on your browser. **Don't clone this!** Instead, look to the rop right of the page for an option to fork the repository. Do this now. This will make a copy of the class repository for your own personal use.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Now that you have a fork of the repository, clone it to your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ASTR_3300_S2025\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Add the original ASTR3300 repository as an `upstream` repository to your fork. First, list the current configured remote repository for your fork with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ git remote -v\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now, add my repo as an upstream:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/NihanPol/ASTR_3300_S2025\n",
    "    \n",
    "Verify that the new repository shows as an `upstream` by running `git remote -v` again.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Get used to syncing upstream content to your fork with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ git fetch upstream\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $ git checkout main\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $ git merge upstream/main\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Now, navigate to `coursework/student_folders` folder. Make a folder in here labeled by your name in all lowercase(i.e. `firstname_lastname`).\n",
    "\n",
    "6) In your folder, make two folders, one called `class_participation` and one called `homework`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Copy your completed lecture notebooks (with all exercises in red finished) to your `class_participation` folder, adding your name to the file (e.g. `Lecture_1b_FirstnameLastname.ipynb`). This is what you will do for each week's lecture notebooks to get participation credit. Your lecture notebooks should have already been copies of my base lecture notebooks. **Never** run my base notebooks; always make a personal copy for yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Copy the **Homework 1** notebook (this file) to your `homework` folder, adding your name (e.g. `Homework_1_FirstnameLastname.ipynb`) \n",
    "\n",
    "9) Complete the other problems listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "10) Submit your homework as follows (making sure that your added files are contained within your student folder):\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ git add path/to/Homework_1_FirstnameLastname.ipynb\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $ git commit -m \"Uploaded Homework 1\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $ git push\n",
    "   \n",
    "11) Similarly add, commit, and push your completed lecture notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "12) On your browser, navigate on GitHub to your fork of the course repository. You should see an option to initiate a `pull request` to merge your changes into the `main` repository. Your homework and lecture notebooks for the week are submitted when you initiate this pull request."

    "\n",
    "5) Compute the mean of $x$ and the mean of $y$. Now compute the median of $x$ and the median of $y$. You should note that the means are different, but the medians (as it is a cumulative statistic) are the same. The mean is affected by the scale of the sample values, but the median only depends on the ordering of the samples. Monotonic transformations (like taking the log) do not change the ordering of samples."
